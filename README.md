# universal_popout

A Node.JS project which includes a JS function for universal popouts.

This is an attempt to create a "catch all" function for popouts, allowing all show/hide elements on the page to be controlled from one place using reserved CSS classes and data attributes to identify how elements are controlled.

This should reduce the ammount of JS required for show/hide elements and enable accessibility functions to be built in at a global level.

A demo of this in action is viewable on Codepen - https://codepen.io/abeeken/pen/YzZWOZj
